   <p> Overwatch is an animated FPS (First Person Shooter) that takes place in the future around the year 2090. It features a "cast" or pool of 25 different charecters (or heroes) that all have unique abilities that help change the course of a game. Each charecter has a unique backstory that is explained throughout voice interactions in the game, official comics released by the creators, posts made by the creators or official animated shorts that span about 8-10 minutes and are a sort of mini movie. I personally love the game and have been playing since a month after it's launch in June 2016. One of the main reasons I still play is because the game has at least one major update every month. These updates can very between a new map, a new charecter or drastically changing a charecters abilities if they are too strong.</p>

 <p> In the game there are 25 different heroes. Each charecter in the image shown (And 1 more called doomfist this is an outdated image) has thier own unique set of 3-5 unique abilities and 1 game changing ultimate. If you would like to learn more about the charecters history and see some cool animated shorts click <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0ahUKEwjjuNLmmObWAhUE_IMKHWrDC0MQFggoMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPLAYFVhxsaqDuOh4Ic5mRu5CiZVKCMVv66&usg=AOvVaw0dV5sGi72THuqf5JI66RkE" target=_blank>here.</a>While I could write a whole 20 page essay on the characters, thier abilities and how they change the game this section will be kept here.

    <p>To conclude the Overwatch section I will talk about the real world events that can take place. So far scince overwatches release it has had 6 new events (summer games, halloween, christmas, lunar new year, uprising and anniversary) 1 has been repeated (summer games 2017) These events feature new limited time skins to make your characters look cool, new gamemodes and remade maps. UPDATE: As this came out on 10/10 a haloween 2017 hit with many new items such as the one in the image shown.</p></body>
